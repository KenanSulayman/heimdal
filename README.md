# Heimdal

Safe, yet incredibly fast cryptography for Node powered by the safe systems language [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), the Rust-bridge framework [Neon](http://neon.rustbridge.io/) and the pure-Rust cryptography library [rust-crypto](https://github.com/DaGenix/rust-crypto).

> I know you loved him. I tried to tell him so, but he wouldnâ€™t listen. So cruel to put the hammer within your reach, knowing that you could never lift it. The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.

### What is heimdal?

heimdal builds on [Neon](http://neon.rustbridge.io/), a Rust-Node bridge and [rust-crypto](https://github.com/DaGenix/rust-crypto), a safe, pure-Rust cryptography library. The goal is to provide safety and performance to developers while maintaining a high level of usability on all supported architectures.

#### Architecture

1. Heimdal consists of only three direct components - a PRNG as entropy source, the business logic and Neon for integration with Node.
2. Rust builds an object file from heimdal and links it to the Node-ABI-specific V8 abstraction layer provided by Neon, finally producing a native Node module.
3. Upon build, the test-suite is executed against the binary, verifying the integrity of the crypto functions and mitigating potential issues caused by unsafe compiler optimisations.

#### Installation

If you're reading this, heimdal may be still too raw for you. However, if you have a nightly Rust toolchain installed, just run `npm i`. This will kickoff the build and test suite.

#### Usage

```
'use strict';

const heimdal = require('heimdal');
```

### Example usage for Ed25519

```
'use strict';

const assert = require('assert');

const heimdal = require('heimdal');
const ed25519 = new heimdal.Ed25519();

const alice = ed25519.keypair();
const bob = ed25519.keypair();

const aliceSharedSecret = ed25519.exchange(alice.public, bob.private);
const bobSharedSecret = ed25519.exchange(bob.public, alice.private);

assert(0 === Buffer.compare(aliceSharedSecret, bobSharedSecret));

const message = new Buffer([

	0x20, 0x69, 0x73, 0x20, 0x64, 0x6f, 0x6e,
	0x65, 0x21
]);

console.log('Message:\n\n%s\n', message.toString());

const aliceSignature = ed25519.signature(message, alice.private);

console.log('Alice signature: ', aliceSignature);

const bobVerification = ed25519.verify(message, alice.public, aliceSignature);

console.log('Bob verification: %s', bobVerification);
```
